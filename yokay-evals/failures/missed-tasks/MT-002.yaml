context:
  task: "Implement user input validation for registration form"

failure:
  description: "Agent implemented all validation rules but forgot to validate email format, even though it was explicitly listed in requirements"
  root_cause: "Agent focused on implementing the more complex validation rules (password strength, username length) and skipped over the standard email validation, possibly assuming it was handled elsewhere"

evidence:
  task_spec: |
    Implement validation for user registration form with the following rules:
    - Username: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric only
    - Email: must be valid email format
    - Password: minimum 8 characters, must contain uppercase, lowercase, and number
    - Password confirmation: must match password

    Return validation errors as an object with field names as keys.

  what_was_built: |
    Validation implemented:
    - Username length and format ✓
    - Password strength requirements ✓
    - Password confirmation match ✓
    - Email format validation ✗ (completely missing)

    Result: Users can register with invalid email addresses like "notanemail"

eval_criteria:
  - type: code-based
    check: "function_contains_email_validation('validate_registration') && (regex_test_exists('email') || email_validator_called())"

  - type: model-based
    check: "Verify all validation rules from requirements are implemented in code, with special attention to standard validations like email format"
