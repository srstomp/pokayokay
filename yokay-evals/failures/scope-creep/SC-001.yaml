severity: medium

context:
  task: "Add a settings page where users can update their profile name and email"

failure:
  description: "Agent implemented the requested settings page but also added unrequested features: dark mode toggle, language preferences, notification settings, and a complete theme customization system"
  root_cause: "Agent likely over-interpreted 'settings page' as requiring all common settings features, rather than implementing only the explicitly requested profile update functionality. This added unnecessary complexity and scope beyond what was asked."

evidence:
  task_spec: |
    Create a settings page for the application with the following functionality:

    Requirements:
    - Form to update user's display name
    - Form to update user's email address
    - Validation for both fields
    - Save button that updates the user profile
    - Success/error messages

    Acceptance Criteria:
    - User can change their name and see it reflected across the app
    - Email validation ensures valid format before save
    - Proper error handling if save fails

  what_was_built: |
    Implemented features:
    - Profile name update form ✓
    - Email update form ✓
    - Validation ✓
    - Save functionality ✓

    EXTRA features NOT requested:
    - Dark mode toggle ✗
    - Language selector (EN, ES, FR, DE) ✗
    - Notification preferences (email, push, SMS) ✗
    - Theme customizer (accent colors, font sizes) ✗
    - Privacy settings section ✗
    - Complete settings navigation sidebar ✗

    Result: Created a complex settings system (500+ lines) when only a simple profile update form (100 lines) was needed.

eval_criteria:
  - type: code-based
    check: "count_components('settings') <= 2 && file_size('settings.tsx') < 200 lines"

  - type: model-based
    check: "Verify implementation includes ONLY the features explicitly listed in requirements, with no additional functionality beyond what was requested"

  - type: model-based
    check: "Compare the scope of what was built against the task specification and flag any features that were not explicitly requested or reasonably implied"
