severity: medium

context:
  task: "Add inline editing for task names in project management dashboard"

failure:
  description: "Agent created a modal dialog for editing task names instead of the requested inline editing functionality"
  root_cause: "Agent may have defaulted to familiar modal pattern or missed the 'inline' requirement, focusing only on 'editing' functionality"

evidence:
  task_spec: |
    Add inline editing capability for task names in the task list.

    Requirements:
    - Click on task name to enter edit mode (no modal/dialog)
    - Show text input field in place of task name
    - Save on Enter key or blur event
    - Cancel on Escape key
    - Update task name via PATCH /api/tasks/:id

    UX Note: Must be inline editing for quick workflows. Users should
    not need to open separate dialogs or navigate away from the list.

  what_was_built: |
    Agent implemented:
    - Click task name opens edit modal dialog ✗
    - Modal contains form with input field ✗
    - Save button in modal calls PATCH /api/tasks/:id ✓
    - Cancel button closes modal ✓
    - Inline editing ✗ (not implemented)

    Result: Users must open a modal for each edit, disrupting workflow.
    Quick bulk editing is cumbersome. UX is much slower than specified.

eval_criteria:
  - type: code-based
    check: "no_modal_in_edit_flow() && edit_input_appears_in_list_dom() && !contains_string('modal', 'dialog', 'popup')"

  - type: model-based
    check: "Verify that editing happens directly in the task list view without opening modals, dialogs, or separate pages. The text input should appear in place of the task name when clicked."
