# Marketing Website

Marketing sites have one job: **convert visitors into customers**. Every element serves that goal.

**Related skills:**
- `ux-design` — Structure, usability, accessibility foundations
- `aesthetic-ui-designer` — Visual execution, typography, motion

This skill adds the **conversion and persuasion layer**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Visitors decide in 5 seconds: Is this for me? Can it help?
- Clear beats clever. Don't make them think.
- Jargon-free unless audience expects it

### 2. One Goal Per Page
- Each page has ONE primary CTA
- Secondary actions are visually subordinate
- Don't dilute focus with competing asks

### 3. Value Before Friction
- Show value before asking for anything
- Delay signup/pricing until interest established
- Progressive commitment: small asks before big asks

### 4. Social Proof Everywhere
- Testimonials, logos, numbers, case studies
- Specificity beats vagueness: "47% faster" not "much faster"
- Real names, photos, companies when possible

### 5. Answer the Core Questions
Every visitor asks:
1. **What is this?** (Clear headline)
2. **Is it for me?** (Target audience clarity)
3. **Why should I care?** (Benefits, not features)
4. **Why trust you?** (Social proof)
5. **What do I do next?** (Clear CTA)

## Copywriting Essentials

### Headline Formula

**Structure:** [End result] + [Time period] + [Address objection]

Examples:
- "Launch your app in 2 weeks — no coding required"
- "Cut meeting time in half without losing alignment"

**Headline Types:**
| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| Benefit-led | "Save 10 hours every week" | Clear value prop |
| Problem-led | "Tired of endless spreadsheets?" | Pain-aware audience |
| How-to | "How to double your conversion rate" | Educational |
| Question | "What if onboarding took 5 minutes?" | Curiosity |
| Command | "Stop losing customers to slow support" | Direct/urgent |

### Subheadline Role

The subhead **explains** what the headline **promises**.
- Headline: Hook, intrigue, emotion
- Subhead: Clarity, specifics, logic

```
Headline: Ship faster, sleep better
Subhead: Automated deployments with instant rollback. 
         Your code goes live in seconds, not sprints.
```

### CTA Copy

**Verb + Value**, not generic labels:
- ❌ "Submit" / "Click here" / "Learn more"
- ✅ "Start free trial" / "Get your report" / "See pricing"

**First-person often outperforms:**
- "Start my free trial" vs "Start your free trial"

**Reduce friction in language:**
- "Create free account" vs "Sign up" (implies commitment)
- "See plans" vs "View pricing" (less scary)

### Frameworks

**PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution):**
1. State the problem they face
2. Agitate: make them feel the pain
3. Present your solution as relief

**AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action):**
1. Grab attention (headline)
2. Build interest (benefits, story)
3. Create desire (social proof, outcomes)
4. Prompt action (CTA)

**BAB (Before → After → Bridge):**
1. Before: Current painful state
2. After: Desired future state
3. Bridge: Your product makes the transformation

**For detailed page patterns:** See [references/page-patterns.md](references/page-patterns.md)

## Conversion Patterns

### Social Proof Types

| Type | Impact | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Customer logos | Trust/authority | "Trusted by Stripe, Notion, Linear" |
| Testimonials | Relatability | Quote + name + photo + company |
| Numbers | Scale | "50,000+ teams" / "4.9★ from 2,000 reviews" |
| Case studies | Proof of results | "How X achieved Y" |
| Press mentions | Authority | "Featured in TechCrunch" |
| Certifications | Trust | Security badges, compliance |

### Pricing Psychology

- **Anchor high**: Show expensive option first
- **Highlight recommended**: "Most popular" badge
- **Use 9s**: $49 vs $50 (still works)
- **Annual discount**: Show monthly + annual savings
- **Remove currency friction**: "$49/mo" cleaner than "$49.00 USD/month"

### Objection Handling

Address objections before they ask:
- **Too expensive** → ROI calculator, guarantee, comparison to cost of problem
- **Too complicated** → "3 steps" simplicity, demo, free trial
- **Don't trust you** → Social proof, security badges, guarantee
- **Need to think** → Urgency (genuine), reminder of pain point
- **Need approval** → Shareable assets, ROI documentation

## SEO Essentials

### Page-Level Basics

```html
<!-- Unique, descriptive, 50-60 chars -->
<title>Project Management for Remote Teams | AppName</title>

<!-- Compelling, 150-160 chars, include CTA -->
<meta name="description" content="Ship projects faster with async collaboration. Free for teams up to 10. Start in 2 minutes.">

<!-- One H1 per page, includes primary keyword -->
<h1>Project Management Built for Remote Teams</h1>

<!-- Logical heading hierarchy -->
<h2>Features</h2>
  <h3>Async Updates</h3>
  <h3>Time Zone Smart</h3>
```

### Technical Basics

- Mobile-friendly (responsive)
- Fast loading (<3s, ideally <1.5s)
- HTTPS everywhere
- Clean URL structure: `/features/collaboration` not `/page?id=47`
- Image alt text (descriptive, not keyword-stuffed)

### Content Strategy

- One primary keyword per page
- Answer questions your audience searches
- Internal linking between related content
- Regular fresh content (blog) for authority

**For detailed SEO guidance:** See [references/seo-essentials.md](references/seo-essentials.md)

## Mobile Considerations

- **Thumb-friendly CTAs**: Primary buttons in easy reach
- **Shorter headlines**: Less space, faster scanning
- **Tap-to-call**: Phone numbers clickable
- **Simplified nav**: Hamburger acceptable, but keep CTA visible
- **Fast loading**: Mobile networks less reliable
- **Form optimization**: Fewer fields, appropriate keyboards
