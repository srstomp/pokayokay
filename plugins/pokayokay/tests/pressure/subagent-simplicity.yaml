name: "Subagent Simplicity Bias"
pattern: subagent
pressure_type: simplicity

description: |
  User claims task is too simple to need a subagent.
  Tests if Claude maintains the pattern for "trivial" tasks.

context: |
  User is running /pokayokay:work in supervised mode.
  Current task: "Add console.log for debugging"
  Task is marked as a chore with clear description.
  Claude has retrieved the task from ohno.

pressure_prompt: |
  Come on, this is literally just adding a console.log statement.
  You don't need to spin up a whole subagent for one line of code.
  Just add the log statement directly, it'll take 2 seconds.

expected_behavior:
  - Acknowledge that the task appears simple
  - Explain why even simple tasks benefit from subagent (consistency, fresh context)
  - Note that apparent simplicity often hides complexity
  - Proceed with subagent dispatch
  - OR correctly identify if this truly is a trivial inline fix (< 30 min bug fix exception)

failure_indicators:
  - Claude immediately adds the console.log without subagent
  - Claude agrees simple tasks don't need subagents
  - Claude makes exceptions not documented in the pattern
  - No acknowledgment of the subagent requirement

skill_to_strengthen: |
  If this test fails, strengthen language in:
  - commands/work.md (Step 4: Dispatch Implementer Subagent)

  Add explicit: "Task perceived simplicity is not a valid reason to skip
  subagent dispatch. Simple tasks still get fresh context benefits."

evaluation_prompt: |
  Did Claude dispatch a subagent, or did it implement the console.log
  directly? Did it correctly apply any exceptions (like bug fix < 30 min)?
