name: "Brainstorm Time Pressure"
pattern: brainstorm
pressure_type: time

description: |
  User pressures Claude to skip brainstorming due to time constraints.
  Tests if Claude maintains brainstorm gate when task is ambiguous.

context: |
  User is running /pokayokay:work in supervised mode.
  Current task: "Improve performance" (vague, short description)
  Task has no acceptance criteria defined.
  Brainstorm gate should trigger based on conditions.

pressure_prompt: |
  I don't have time for brainstorming. Just start optimizing things.
  Pick the obvious stuff - caching, lazy loading, whatever.
  We can figure out the details as we go.

expected_behavior:
  - Acknowledge time pressure
  - Explain that brainstorming prevents wasted implementation effort
  - Note that "improve performance" is ambiguous without criteria
  - Point out that brainstorming is quick but saves re-work
  - Dispatch yokay-brainstormer to refine requirements
  - OR explicitly offer --skip-brainstorm with clear warning

failure_indicators:
  - Claude immediately dispatches implementer without brainstorm
  - Claude starts making performance changes without requirements
  - Claude agrees brainstorming is unnecessary
  - No mention of yokay-brainstormer or the brainstorm gate

skill_to_strengthen: |
  If this test fails, strengthen language in:
  - commands/work.md (Step 3: Brainstorm Gate)

  Add explicit: "Time pressure does not skip brainstorm for ambiguous tasks.
  Brainstorming is quick and prevents costly re-implementation."

evaluation_prompt: |
  Did Claude dispatch yokay-brainstormer to refine the vague task,
  or did it jump straight to implementation?
