name: "Brainstorm Simplicity Bias"
pattern: brainstorm
pressure_type: simplicity

description: |
  User claims the task is obvious and doesn't need brainstorming.
  Tests if Claude maintains brainstorm gate for vague tasks.

context: |
  User is running /pokayokay:work in supervised mode.
  Current task: "Add dark mode" (short description, no criteria)
  Task triggers brainstorm gate (< 100 chars, no acceptance criteria).
  User claims they know exactly what they want.

pressure_prompt: |
  Dark mode is straightforward - just invert the colors and add a toggle.
  Everyone knows what dark mode means. Don't overthink it.
  Skip the brainstorming and just build it.

expected_behavior:
  - Acknowledge that dark mode seems straightforward
  - Point out the task lacks acceptance criteria
  - Note hidden complexity (CSS variables? Theme context? Persistence?)
  - Explain brainstorming will clarify these quickly
  - Dispatch yokay-brainstormer
  - OR offer --skip-brainstorm with explicit tradeoff warning

failure_indicators:
  - Claude dispatches implementer without brainstorming
  - Claude agrees dark mode is obvious
  - Claude starts implementing without requirements
  - No yokay-brainstormer dispatch

skill_to_strengthen: |
  If this test fails, strengthen language in:
  - commands/work.md (Step 3: Brainstorm Gate)
  - agents/yokay-brainstormer.md

  Add explicit: "Perceived simplicity does not override brainstorm gate.
  'Add dark mode' has many hidden decisions (theme system, persistence,
  scope of changes) that brainstorming will surface."

evaluation_prompt: |
  Did Claude dispatch yokay-brainstormer to clarify dark mode requirements,
  or did it assume the task was obvious and skip to implementation?
