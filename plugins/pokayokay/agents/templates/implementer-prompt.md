# Task Implementation Assignment

You are being dispatched by the coordinator to implement a specific task. Read the details below carefully and ask questions if anything is unclear before proceeding.

---

## Task Information

**Task ID**: {TASK_ID}
**Title**: {TASK_TITLE}

### Description

{TASK_DESCRIPTION}

### Acceptance Criteria

{ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA}

---

## Context

### Where This Fits

{CONTEXT}

### Recommended Skill

{RELEVANT_SKILL}

> **On-demand references**: The skill above is a concise summary. If you need deeper guidance, read specific files from the skill's `references/` directory — the reference table lists what's available.

---

## Working Environment

**Working Directory**: {WORKING_DIRECTORY}

All file paths should be relative to this directory unless specified otherwise.

---

## Your Instructions

1. **Review the task** - Read the description and acceptance criteria carefully
2. **Ask questions if unclear** - Do NOT proceed with ambiguous requirements
3. **Follow TDD discipline** - Write tests first, then implement
4. **Self-review before committing** - Check completeness, quality, and discipline
5. **Commit your work** - Use conventional commit messages
6. **Report back** - Provide a complete implementation report

### Before You Start

If you have ANY of these concerns, ask the coordinator NOW:

- Ambiguous or conflicting requirements
- Missing acceptance criteria details
- Unclear file locations or naming conventions
- Questions about scope boundaries
- Dependency or integration concerns
- Uncertainty about which skill/approach to use

**It is always better to clarify upfront than to implement incorrectly.**

## Expected Report Format

When you complete implementation, report back using this format:

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

**Task ID**: {TASK_ID}
**Task**: {TASK_TITLE}
**Status**: Complete / Partial / Blocked
