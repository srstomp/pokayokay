# Deep Research

Comprehensive investigation that informs major decisions. Produces structured reports for stakeholders.

## Deep Research vs Spike

| | Spike | Deep Research |
|-|-------|---------------|
| Duration | Hours | Days |
| Scope | Single question | Multiple questions |
| Output | GO/NO-GO decision | Comprehensive report |
| Depth | Proof of concept | Full evaluation |

## Key Principles

- Define research questions and success criteria upfront
- Evaluate multiple options against consistent criteria
- Synthesize findings into actionable recommendations
- Track progress through ohno for multi-session continuity

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Define research questions (what decisions need data?)
2. Set evaluation criteria (what matters for comparison?)
3. Gather sources (docs, benchmarks, case studies, experiments)
4. Compare options against criteria systematically
5. Synthesize findings and form recommendations
6. Present report with clear decision guidance
