# Documentation

Create clear, maintainable technical documentation that serves your audience.

## Key Principles

- **Documentation as code** — docs live with code, version with code, review with code
- **Audience-first writing** — write for who's reading, not what you know
- **Maintainability over completeness** — inaccurate docs are worse than no docs
- **Link to source of truth** — don't duplicate information across docs

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Identify documentation type (README, API docs, ADR, user guide)
2. Determine audience (all users, developers, team, contributors)
3. Follow type-specific template from references
4. Include working examples (test them!)
5. Link to related documentation

## Documentation Types

| Type | When to Use | Audience |
|------|-------------|----------|
| README | Project entry point | All users |
| API Docs | Endpoint reference | Developers |
| ADR | Major decisions | Team/future devs |
| User Guide | Task completion | End users |
