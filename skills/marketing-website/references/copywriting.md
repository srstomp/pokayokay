## Framework Deep Dives

### PAS Framework (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

**Problem:** State the problem clearly
```
Managing customer support across email, chat, and social 
is a nightmare. Messages slip through cracks. Customers 
wait hours for responses. Your team drowns in tabs.
```

**Agitate:** Make them feel the pain
```
Every missed message is a lost customer. Every slow 
response is a 1-star review. Your competitors reply 
in minutes while you're still searching for context.
```

**Solution:** Present your answer
```
Helpdesk Pro brings every conversation into one inbox. 
See full customer history instantly. Reply everywhere 
from one screen. Never miss another message.
```

### AIDA Framework (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

**Attention:** Hook with headline
```
Cut Your Meeting Time in Half
```

**Interest:** Build with benefits
```
MeetingZero uses AI to summarize discussions, assign action 
items, and skip the meetings that should've been emails.
```

**Desire:** Create want with proof
```
Teams using MeetingZero save 5+ hours per week. 
"We cancelled 60% of our recurring meetings." — Sarah, VP Eng
```

**Action:** Clear next step
```
Try free for 14 days. No credit card. Setup in 2 minutes.
[Start Saving Time →]
```

### BAB Framework (Before → After → Bridge)

**Before:** Paint current painful state
```
Right now, your sales team spends 4 hours daily on admin. 
Logging calls, updating CRM, writing follow-ups. 
That's half their day NOT selling.
```

**After:** Paint desired future state
```
Imagine if every call was automatically logged, every 
contact enriched, every follow-up drafted. Your team 
sells 4 more hours every day.
```

**Bridge:** Your product makes the transformation
```
SalesBot AI handles the busywork. Your team handles 
the relationships. Average user closes 40% more deals.
```

### 4 Ps Framework (Promise → Picture → Proof → Push)

**Promise:** What they'll get
```
Double your email revenue in 90 days.
```

**Picture:** Help them visualize
```
Imagine opening your dashboard to see orders rolling 
in from emails that write themselves. Personalized 
for each customer, sent at the perfect time.
```

**Proof:** Evidence it works
```
"We went from $12k to $31k monthly email revenue in 
8 weeks." — Maya, Founder of ThreadCo
```

**Push:** Prompt action
```
Start your free trial. See results in week one.
[Grow My Revenue →]
```

## Copy Testing

### What to Test

- **Headlines**: Often highest impact
- **CTAs**: Button text, color, placement
- **Social proof**: Testimonial selection, placement
- **Pricing presentation**: Framing, anchoring

### Quick Validation

Before testing with real users:
1. Does the headline pass the 5-second test?
2. Can someone understand the value prop without scrolling?
3. Is the CTA clear and compelling?
4. Would you click this? Be honest.

### The Bar Test

Read your copy aloud. Would you say this to a friend at a bar? If it sounds robotic or corporate, rewrite it.
